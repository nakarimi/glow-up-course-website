    excerpt: "Recent surveys indicate a shift in employer priorities toward soft skills development.",
    content: `
      <p>Recent industry surveys have revealed an interesting shift in employer priorities, with a growing emphasis on soft skills development. According to the data, while technical skills remain important, organizations are increasingly recognizing the value of employees who possess strong communication, leadership, and problem-solving abilities.</p>
      
      <p>The surveys indicate that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>93% of employers consider soft skills to be either "essential" or "very important" when hiring</li>
        <li>Employees with strong soft skills are 12% more productive on average</li>
        <li>Teams with high emotional intelligence scores outperform others by 50% in key performance indicators</li>
        <li>89% of HR professionals report that when a hire doesn't work out, it's typically due to a lack of soft skills rather than technical abilities</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>In response to these findings, we've expanded our soft skills course offerings to include new programs focused on emotional intelligence, conflict resolution, adaptive leadership, and effective communication in remote work environments.</p>
      
      <p>Explore our updated course catalog to find the right soft skills training for your team's development needs.</p>
